Mina always sat by the window in class, pretending she was paying attention but actually daydreaming about dipping from her small 
town. Every day felt like a rerun, same faces, same dusty roads, same everything. But today, there was this random silver envelope
in her locker with her name on it — no sender, just a wax seal and major mysterious energy. Inside was a ticket to the city’s tech
showcase and a note that said, “Dreams don’t chase themselves.” She low-key freaked out, but in a good way.

Instead of heading home after school like usual, Mina hopped on the next bus out. The city lights hit different — all neon, loud, 
alive. She wandered around the showcase, eyes sparkling at the robots, VR setups, and gadgets she thought only existed online. For 
the first time, she believed she belonged somewhere bigger. And as she stood there, clutching that silver envelope, she whispered 
to herself, “This is just Level 1.”
